# Summer of JavaScript Coding Challenges
This repo contains code solutions and tests for the Codesmith _Summer of
JavaScript_ email series.

## Getting started
Make sure you have installed a recent version of Nodejs. You can download it
from [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

If you have git configured on your computer ([read about how to do that
here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)) you
can do `$ git clone https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/summer-of-js.git` on 
terminal and download all the code in this repo.
<br>
Once downloaded the code can be read through and the tests can be changed or
added to. There are comments in the code that outline some of the though process behind
arriving at the solutions.

## Running the tests
To run the tests first install any dependencies from [npm](npmjs.com) by running
```bash
$ npm install
```
in a terminal from inside the `summer-of-js` folder. This will download the test
library [Tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) we're using to run our tests.
<br>
A custom test script is provided that allows you to run individual tests for
each challenge. You can run that script by doing:
```bash
$ npm test <challenge name>
```
For example, if I want to run tests for the `balance-index` challenge I'll run
`$ npm test balance-index` in a terminal window.
